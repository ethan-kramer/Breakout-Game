# Breakout-Game
Object-oriented C++ project for a breakout style video game using the Open-GL library. The user moves the paddle at the bottom of the screen to get the ball to hit the bricks at the top of the screen. When a pathway has been made to the top of the screen through the blocks, or the ball hits the bottom of the screen, the game is over. (End of Semester Project for Programming II in C++).<br>
* This project exemplifies concepts like inheritance between classes, polymorphism, using header files, subclassing, encapsulation mechanisms, and using iterators/operations on aggregates.
